# Module 11 - UFO Sightings with JavaScript

## Overview of Project
In this challenge provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, youâ€™ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Analysis Using Javascript
* Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria
* A written report on the UFO analysis (README.md)
In order to run the application you need to start a simple web server in Python. 
1. In Anaconda, open the command prompt, change the directory to where the application exists (D:\Data_Visualization_and_Analytics_Boot_Camp\11_Challenge)
2. Start the simple webserver from the Anaconda command prompt: python -m http.server
3. Open the application: http://localhost:8000/index.html

**Deliverable 1** 
* The list element that creates the button is removed, and there are five list elements for filtering 
	in the index.html file:

![Filtering](https://github.com/lykkelig/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/UFO_Web_Page_Selection.png)

* The event listener is modified to detect changes to each filter in the app.js file.
*   	// 4a. Save the element that was changed as a variable.
*   	let changedElement = d3.select(this);

* The updateFilters() function saves the element, value, and the id of the filter that was changed:
		*See in app.js: function updateFilters() for complete code*
* The filterTable() function loops through all of the filters and keeps any data that matches the filter values.
		*See in app.js: function filterTable(obj)*

* The webpage filters the table correctly based on user input:

## Summary  (Deliverable 2) 
* Finished WebPage: ![UFO](https://github.com/lykkelig/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/UFO_Web_Page.png)
* Drawback: There are no drop down elements to aid in the selection process.

* The application is rather simple, it loads a table of UFO sightings that are located on the local host. A more robust application would use a database on a cloud platform that would keep the UFO sighting data updated. Although a simple application, it has it's uses allowing a user with no network or Internet connections to query UFO sightings with 5 different filters.
